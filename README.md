# SPI_Protocol
A simple implementation of SPI protocol communication using VHDL 

The Objective of this project is to design and simulate SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol for Master and Slave as state machines in VHDL. Master and Slave is designed to send and receive serial data. Design is functionally verified by simulation of VHDL program.
